<h1>Information about the Project for Participation</h1>
    
<h3>Explanation of the purposes of the research, written in an unbiased way.</h3>
<p>The project “AI-based Assistive & Passive Technology for non-Invasive Elderly care (ADAPTIVE)” is a collaborative project funded by Innovate UK. The project aims to provide smart-health support to the elderly and People Living with Dementia (PLWD) at home/care environments, by utilising an innovative Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform, known as miiCUBE.</p>
<p>Experiments will be carried out for conducting a controlled experiment in the university premise(s) to collect data from healthy participants using miiCUBE and an accelerometer device in order to validate the data recorded by miiCUBE in addition to producing efficient algorithms to detect footsteps in homes/care environments. Algorithms are expected to be developed in a way where “footsteps” sounds will be treated as the final output or desired sound and the surrounding environmental sounds will be treated as background noise or unwanted sound that need to be removed to generate the final sounds or acoustic signals.</p>

<h3>Why you have been asked to take part in this research project as a participant?</h3>
<p>Clean footstep sounds are required for this study to recognise features for detecting sounds in home/care environments. The participants are asked to take part in this research project to initiate the study. They will be asked to walk at different pace and postures for the footstep sounds to be recorded. The neat footstep sounds are to be mixed with environmental sounds to investigate miiCUBE along with the recognition techniques.</p>

<h3>Any regulation on wearables or clothing?</h3>
<p>We request participants to not wear any clothing that may generate significant noise when walking, such as waterproof trouser.</p>
<p>We request participants to either wear shoes which do not have laces, or to secure their shoelaces within their shoes to avoid any sounds produced by the laces during walking. It will be convenient if they are wearing sock, in case, they need to remove their shoes to take part in the study.</p>  

<h3>Will there be any audio/video recording?</h3>
<p>The footstep sounds will be recorded using microphones. Sound will be recorded only during the walking experiments.</p>
<p>There will be no video recording.</p>

<h3>How much time commitment is required from participants?</h3>
<p>A maximum of one-hour is required from the participants.</p>

<h3>Is participation voluntary?</h3>
<p>Anyone can participate in this study. It is not compulsory for anyone to participate in this study. An Amazon voucher of £20 will be given to each participant to thank them for their time in the study.</p>
<p>The subject can ask questions anytime and they can withdraw at any time from the research without consequences.</p>

<h3>How Covid-19 related regulations will be followed?</h3>
<p>Only one participant is invited to take part at a time. A maximum of two researchers will be present. They will be wearing their masks and the participants can keep their masks on throughout the study. Sanitisers will be present.</p>

<h3>Will there be any personal information collection from the participants? Is there any chance that the subject will be identified? What is the provision for data sharing and how will the data be anonymised?</h3> 
<p>No personal information will be collected. The researchers involved with this study will use the various footstep details collected in developing the appropriate algorithms. No recorded data will be associated with the participant’s identity, and we do not anticipate that there is any way of revealing the identity of the participant(s) through the analysis of the collected data.</p>

<h3>What are the procedures adopted for ensuring data protection/confidentiality/privacy including duration of storage of personal data?</h3>
<p>All collected data will be stored in secure password-protected computers. The collected data will not be linked with the participants’ identities in any way.</p>

<h3>Who is funding the research?</h3>
<p>Innovate U.K.</p>

<h3>Who has ethically approved the project?</h3>
<p>Ethics Department of School of Computing at University of Kent has approved this study.</p>

<h3>Any foreseeable risk or disadvantages?</h3>
<p>None.</p>

<h3>Whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects’ rights, and whom to contact in the event of a complaint, etc.</h3>
<p>Christos Efstratiou: << C.Efstratiou@kent.ac.uk >> </p>

<h3>What will happen to the results of the research, and an opportunity to be provided with information about the findings?</h3>
<p>If the participants would like to know about the results of the research or findings, please contact the researchers mentioned previously.</p>
    
<h3>When can the participants join the study?</h3>
<p>We would like to initialise the study by mid-August and run it till first week of September. If anyone is interested to participate, they can email us with their preferable time.</p>
